# A few words

I  teach finance at emlyon business school, mainly about the  topic of interest rates. My research interests lie in economics of risk, using numerical and theoretical approaches. I am mainly interested in the impact of risk on asset prices and household behaviors, by taking into account incomplete markets or specific risk preferences.
