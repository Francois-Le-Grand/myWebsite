# Working papers

%pclass-no-bottom-space%[On Monotone Recursive Preferences](./docs/wp/BKL_MonotonePreferences.pdf) (with A. Bommier and A. Kochov). Revise and resubmit.

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>We prove that risk-sensitive preferences are the only preferences to be monotone and to disentangle risk aversion and elasticity of substitution.</small></small>

%pclass-no-bottom-space%[Asset Returns, Idiosyncratic and Aggregate Risk Exposure](./docs/wp/LR_RiskExposure.pdf) (with X. Ragot). Submitted.

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>We propose class of tractable incomplete-market models, with  aggregate risk and financial  participation costs, that enables to quantitatively reproduce US asset price properties and  the risk  exposure of US households.</small></small>


%pclass-no-bottom-space%[Risk Aversion and Precautionary Savings in Dynamic Settings](./docs/wp/BL_PrecautionarySavings.pdf) (with A. Bommier). Submitted.

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>In a very general infinite-horizon setting, precautionary savings are proved to covary positively with risk aversion, whenever preferences are monotone and the income process is stochastically monotone.</small></small>


%pclass-no-bottom-space%[Nelson and Siegel, No--Arbitrage and Risk Premium](./docs/wp/L_NelsonSiegel.pdf).  

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>We estimate the quantitative impacts of imposing no-arbitrage restrictions to a Nelson and Siegel model.</small></small>

# Work in Progress

%pclass-no-bottom-space%Optimal Policy with Heterogeneous Agents and Aggregate Shocks : An Application to Optimal Public Debt Dynamics(with X. Ragot).

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>We propose a framework to compute optimal Ramsey policies in incomplete market economies with aggregate risk.</small></small>


%pclass-no-bottom-space%A Bird in the Hand is Worth Two in the Grave. Risk Aversion and Life-Cycle (with A. Bommier and D. Harenberg).

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>We analyze the role of risk aversion in a life cycle model featuring several risks. Larger risk aversion is shown to decrease savings.</small></small>

%pclass-no-bottom-space%<small><small>Default and Credit Constraints in General Equilibrium (with X. Ragot).</small></small>

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>We propose a framework to analyze default  in incomplete market economies with aggregate risk.</small></small>

%pclass-no-bottom-space%Limited Participation In The Joint Behavior Of Asset Prices And Individual Consumptions (with V. Czellar).

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>We estimate using indirect inference techniques  a parsimonious asset pricing model featuring limited participation.</small></small>

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>In a model-free framework, risk aversion is found to have an intuitive impact. The more risk averse the agent, the closer her behaviour to the one in a bad state.</small></small>

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>In an incomplete market economy with aggregate risk, a larger bond volume is found to increase both the level and the slope of the term structure of interest rates.</small></small>

%pclass-no-top-space-indent%<small><small>In a life-cycle model, risk aversion is found to decrease the demand for annuities: Risk attitudes may then contribute to explain the "annuity puzzle".</small></small>

markets when extraction costs are non-convex and resource storage is possible.</small></small>
